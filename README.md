Pipelined_CPU
=============

Pipelined CPU runs MIPS Instruction Set.

It is a project in my sophomore year in Computer Architecture. It is a interesting job, because we can download the CPU and run it on FPGA Altera DE2-70. When we run a lot of MIPS in our own CPU, the feeling is very wonderful!!!
